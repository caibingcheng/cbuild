## introduction

**if you will, please help me to complete or improve this tool.**

it will help you create your C++ project quickly.

you can use this tool to cerate\build\run\remove your project, it is more easier than that you do those by default commands such as cmake. 

## version

- version: 0.0    base functions
- version: 0.1    use template files
- version: 0.5    restructure the source code and optimize the parameters

## install

clone this repository or download it.

default install
```shell
sh ./install.sh
```
force reinstall
```shell
sh ./install.sh -f
```

the cbuild tools will be copy to ~/.cbuild.
after installing, you'd better to restart the terminal

## usage

this tool will remember the last project you build, so you can ignore the parameter [project] if you are working on the last project.

be cautiousï¼Œ you can not ellipsis the second parameter at the first time

```shell
cbuild -a project #add your project
cbuild -c project #create your project
cbuild -r project #remove your project
cbuild -b project #build your project by cmake
cbuild -e project #execute your project
cbuild -f         #force switch
cbuild -h         #show help

cbuild -R         #remove the remebered project
cbuill -B         #build the remebered project
cbuild -E         #execute the remebered project
```

otherwise, you are able to modify the template files to customize your base-project.

these template files are lay on ~/.cbuild/
